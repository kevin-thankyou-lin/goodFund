# goodFund

A new version of crowdfunding platform - GoodFund. We believe that current crowdfunding platforms have two major flaws: 

1. They lack protection for backers
2. They come with excessive transaction fees

We propose that blockchain technology can mitigate these flaws. GoodFund protects backers from scams and decreases transaction costs for creators to create a system incentivized to deliver on innovative products and services.

Built using Solidity, Web3.js, React.js and Bootstrap.
